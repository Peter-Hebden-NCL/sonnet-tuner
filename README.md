# Sonnet Tuner reading interface

**This is a template for a poetry interface that uses a slider to move between texts. The movement of the slider causes words from each of the poems to fade in and out on the display, with a full, coherent version of each poem being displayed at a particular point on the slider.**



### Content

This code repository contains the source code for the interface, which is contained within the single index.html file. This includes the CSS and Javascript for the project. 

All of the poems used have been replaced with placeholder text, which is clearly indicated in the file.
